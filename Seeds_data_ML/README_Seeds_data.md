## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is a **seeds dataset**, which includes different measurements of various seeds from three different wheat varieties. The goal of this project is to classify seeds based on their features.

- **File `seeds_dataset.txt`**: Contains the dataset with features representing different seed measurements.

## 🚀 How to Use This Notebook

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook
- Required Python packages (Install via `requirements.txt` or use the list of imports in the notebook)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running the Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `Seeds_data.ipynb` is the main file for this project. It walks you through the data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation steps.

To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Seeds_data_ML.git
cd Seeds_data_ML
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Seeds_data.ipynb
```

3. Follow the cells and instructions in the notebook. You will find sections on:

   - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand patterns and insights.
   - **Machine Learning Model**: Building and training a model to classify seed types.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

### 3. Important Sections of the Notebook

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  This section handles missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  Key visualizations and statistical summaries are included to help understand the structure and distribution of the data.

- **Model Training**:
  A machine learning model is built and trained on the dataset. You can experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters here.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  After training the model, performance metrics are computed and displayed, allowing you to assess the model's accuracy in classifying different seed types.

### 4. Dataset Details

The **seeds dataset** contains several features that represent seed measurements, such as:

- Area
- Perimeter
- Compactness
- Length of Kernel
- Width of Kernel
- Asymmetry Coefficient
- Length of Kernel Groove

Each seed belongs to one of three different wheat varieties.

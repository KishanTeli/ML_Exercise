## üìä Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is the **Seoul Bike Share Dataset**, which includes various weather and time-based features, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and holiday information, to predict the demand for bike rentals in Seoul.

- **File `SeoulBikeData.csv`**: Contains the dataset with features related to bike-sharing demand.

## üöÄ How to Use This Notebook

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook
- Required Python packages (Install via `requirements.txt` or use the list of imports in the notebook)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running the Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `SeoulBike.ipynb` is the main file for this project. It walks you through the data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation steps.

To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KishanTeli/ML_Exercise.git
cd ML_Exercise
cd SeoulBike_data_ML
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook SeoulBike.ipynb
```

3. Follow the cells and instructions in the notebook. You will find sections on:

   - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand patterns and insights.
   - **Machine Learning Model**: Building and training a model to predict bike-sharing demand.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.

### 3. Important Sections of the Notebook

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  This section handles missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  Key visualizations and statistical summaries are included to help understand the structure and distribution of the data.

- **Model Training**:
  A machine learning model is built and trained on the dataset. You can experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters here.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  After training the model, performance metrics are computed and displayed, allowing you to assess the model's ability to predict bike-sharing demand accurately.

### 4. Dataset Details

The **Seoul Bike Share Dataset** contains several features, including:

- Date
- Rented Bike Count
- Hour
- Temperature (Celsius)
- Humidity (%)
- Windspeed (m/s)
- Visibility (10m)
- Dew Point Temperature (Celsius)
- Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)
- Rainfall (mm)
- Snowfall (cm)
- Holiday (Yes/No)
- Seasons
- Functioning Day (Yes/No)

The target variable is the **Rented Bike Count**, and the goal is to predict the demand based on various features.

## üìä Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is the **MAGIC Gamma Telescope** dataset, which consists of data derived from signals in a gamma telescope. The goal is to classify whether the detected signal is a **gamma signal** or a **hadron signal**.

- **File `magic04.data`**: Contains the dataset with features representing various signal characteristics.
- **File `magic04.names`**: Provides detailed descriptions of each feature and the target labels (gamma vs. hadron).

## üöÄ How to Use This Notebook

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook
- Required Python packages (Install via `requirements.txt` or use the list of imports in the notebook)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running the Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook `magic_Analyis.ipynb` is the main file for this project. It walks you through the data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation steps.

To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KishanTeli/ML_Exercise.git
cd ML_Exercise
cd Magic_Data_Exercise
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook magic_Analyis.ipynb
```

3. Follow the cells and instructions in the notebook. You will find sections on:

   - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand patterns and insights.
   - **Machine Learning Model**: Building and training a model to classify gamma vs. hadron signals.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

### 3. Important Sections of the Notebook

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  This section handles missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  Key visualizations and statistical summaries are included to help understand the structure and distribution of the data.

- **Model Training**:
  A machine learning model is built and trained on the dataset. You can experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters here.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  After training the model, performance metrics are computed and displayed, allowing you to assess the model's accuracy and precision in classifying gamma and hadron signals.

### 4. Dataset Details

- **Features**: 
  The dataset contains several features such as `fLength`, `fWidth`, `fSize`, `fConc`, `fM3Long`, and others, representing different characteristics of the detected signal.

- **Target**:
  The target label is binary, where:
  - **1**: Gamma signal
  - **0**: Hadron signal

For more details on the features, refer to the `magic04.names` file.

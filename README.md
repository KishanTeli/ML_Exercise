## 🧑‍🏫 What's Included

- **Magic_data_ML**: Explore the **MAGIC Gamma Telescope** dataset to classify gamma versus hadron signals. Get hands-on with machine learning models to solve this binary classification problem.
- **Seeds_data_ML**: Work with the **Seeds Dataset** to classify wheat varieties using various seed measurements. This is a fun classification problem to understand data relationships.
- **SeoulBike_data_ML**: Dive into the **Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset** to predict bike-sharing demand based on weather and seasonal data. You'll learn how to build regression models for accurate predictions.

Each project folder has its own **README.md** file that provides detailed instructions on how to use the included Jupyter notebooks and datasets.

## 🧠 Learn Machine Learning in a Fun Way

Machine learning is all about teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions. Here are some fun facts about ML:

- **Supervised learning** is like having a teacher — you provide the model with labeled data (inputs and their correct outputs) to learn from.
- **Unsupervised learning** is like being an explorer — the model tries to find patterns in unlabeled data, like grouping similar items together.
- **Regression** is when you want to predict a continuous value (like predicting bike rentals).
- **Classification** is when you want to put things into categories (like predicting whether something is a gamma signal or a hadron signal).

You’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice these concepts with the datasets in this repo.

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ML_Exercise.git
cd ML_Exercise
```

2. Navigate to any of the project folders (e.g., `Magic_data_ML/`, `Seeds_data_ML/`, or `SeoulBike_data_ML/`) to find project-specific instructions in the `README.md` file located in each folder.

3. Follow the steps in each notebook to run machine learning models on the datasets and explore the results!
